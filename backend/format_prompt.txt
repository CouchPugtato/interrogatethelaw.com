You will receive the full body text of a law as it appears on a public website. Your task is to extract only the official legislative content, starting from the first actual section, article, clause, or bullet point of the legislation (whichever comes first) and continuing through to the very last piece of substantive legislative content.
Do not include: – Titles, headers, or summaries before the first numbered or titled provision – Preambles, legislative findings, editor’s notes, introductions, or table of contents – Any footers, amendment notes, history, references, citations, or appendices after the final section – Any commentary, annotations, or interpretation
Formatting Requirements: – Preserve the exact wording, punctuation, and sequence of the original legislative content – Any list item or clause marked with a bullet (•, –, *, or similar) in the source must remain a bullet point in the output – If the source uses sub-points (e.g., 7a, 7b, 7c or (i), (ii), (iii)) under a numbered or bulleted item, indent and nest them as sub-bullets beneath their parent item – Maintain indentation and nesting hierarchy exactly as logically implied in the structure
Important: – Begin with the first actual line of legislation (e.g., "Section 1.", "Article I.", or similar) – Do not stop early. Continue until the entire legislative body is reproduced in full – Reread and verify to ensure no legal content is skipped or misclassified. Only end output once all legislative content has been included exactly as it appears in the source
